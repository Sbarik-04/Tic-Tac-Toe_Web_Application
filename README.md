Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application
ðŸ§© About the Project:
This Tic-Tac-Toe web application was developed as part of my internship task at Prodigy Infotech. The goal was to create an interactive and responsive browser-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through this project, I implemented features like:

User input handling through clicks

Game state management for both players

Logic to determine wins, draws, and resets

Option to play against another user
